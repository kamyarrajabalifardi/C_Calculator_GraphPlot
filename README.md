A simple Calculator with
* `+`
* `-`
* `*`
* `/`

operators in C.

The user write a string in terminal consisting of the mentioned operators and `(`, `)`. To calculate the expression, stack data structure is use to detect parantheses and calculate parts with higher priority.

# Graph Plotter
In this section the user writes a math expression as a function of $x$, such as `x*x*x + 2*x-5`. Then a `.bmp` file will be created that contains the plot of this function.

Example
-------
**Input:** `x*x*x-2*x*x+sin(5*x)-cos(x)`
